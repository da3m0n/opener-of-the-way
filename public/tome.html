  <h2>On gateways</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gateways are encrypted TrueCrypt volumes shared on the local network.</li>
    <li>Source gateways are used to proffer (share) artifacts (files) to other cultists (users)
      <ul>
        <li>Used in a read only mode.</li>
        <li>Opened regularly to scan for newly proffered artifacts.</li>
        <li>Artifacts are available for other cultists to clone only while the original is available in your source gateway.</li>
        <li>Some artifacts are ignored:
          <ul>
            <li>Any files under the following special folders: <pre>/clones/</pre> or <pre>/ignored/</pre></li>
            <li>Any hidden files (prefixed with a &quot;.&quot; character), for example <pre>/.Trash-41231/Deleted-file.txt</pre> or <pre>/.settings</pre></li>
            <li>Known system files, for example <pre>/System Volume Information/</pre> or <pre>/Recycled</pre></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Sink gateways are used to clone (copy) artifacts (files) that were proffered (shared) by other cultists (users).
      <ul>
        <li>Used in a write only mode.</li>
        <li>Opened only to clone artifacts.</li>
        <li>Cloned artifacts are placed under the folder <pre>/clones/</pre></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In this way artifacts are never stored on disk in plain-text.</li>
    <li>Cultists should never locally mount a gateway TrueCrypt volume while oOoo* has the gateway open. To do so may cause corruption.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>On creating a gateway</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a (windows) network share, with appropriate permissions...
      <ul><li>Sink: The share must allow <em>write access</em> to &quot;Everyone&quot; if you wish to receive clones.</li><li>Source: The share must allow <em>read access</em> to &quot;Everyone&quot;.</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>Create a <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads">TrueCrypt 7</a> encrypted volume in that share, using the "create volume" wizard following the instructions below:
        <ol>
            <li>Create an encrypted file container</li>
            <li>Standard TrueCrypt volume</li>
            <li>Volume location should be in the network-share created earlier, with any name. The name should be either obscure or the name of commonly large files such as: <pre>pc678.vmdk</pre> or <pre>install.GHO</pre> or <pre>hiberfil.sys</pre></li>
            <li>Default encryption options</li>
            <li>Volume size should be fixed (as variable sized volumes can cause corruption), and recommend >10GB size if possible (it will fill fast)</li>
            <li>I will not store files larger than 4GB on the volume. (Only on Ubuntu as this enables selection of FAT in the next step).</li>
            <li>FAT file system</li>
            <li>Format</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Ensure the encrypted volume file has appropriate permissions...
      <ul><li>Sink: <em>read-write</em> permissions</li><li>Source: <em>read-only</em> permissions</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>In oOoo* <a href="/gateway/add">add a gateway</a> with these details, selecting the correct mode, source or sink, depending on the use.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>On avoiding insanity</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Cultists using Ubuntu should ensure that when removing unwanted files from a gateway that they permanently remove (e.g. shift-delete) the files, as otherwise the file is just moved to a hidden .Trash directory in the gateway root directory.</li>
    <li>Cultists using Windows 7 may have clones fail repeatedly. If so this is likely due to a known Windows 7 issue. Please refer to <a href="http://alan.lamielle.net/2009/09/03/windows-7-nonpaged-pool-srv-error-2017">http://alan.lamielle.net/2009/09/03/windows-7-nonpaged-pool-srv-error-2017</a></li>
    <li>Gateways on USB disks may occassionaly fail due to timeout in data send/receive. Recommend using USB 3.0 devices in a USB 3.0 SS compatible port (look for SS mark on USB port, super speed).</li>
    <li>Cultists code-names are plucked at random from the ether.</li>
