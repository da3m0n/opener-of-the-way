  <h2>On oOoo*</h2>

    <li>There is no oOoo*</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>On gateways</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gateways (TrueCrypt volumes shared on the network) are used to proffer (share) artifacts (files) to other cultists (users), or to clone (copy) artifacts that were proffered by others.</li>
    <li>In this way no artifacts touch disk in plain-text.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>On creating a gateway</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a (windows) network share, with appropriate permissions...
      <ul><li>Sink: The share must allow <em>write access</em> to &quot;Everyone&quot; if you wish to receive clones.</li><li>Source: The share must allow <em>read access</em> to &quot;Everyone&quot;.</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>Create a <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads">TrueCrypt 7</a> encrypted volume in that share, using the "create volume" wizard following the instructions below:
        <ol>
            <li>Create an encrypted file container</li>
            <li>Standard TrueCrypt volume</li>
            <li>Volume location should be in the network-share created earlier, with any name, preferably obscure such as &quot;disk.iso&quot; or &quot;hiberfil.sys&quot; or &quot;data.dump&quot;</li>
            <li>Default encryption options</li>
            <li>Volume size should be fixed (as variable sized volumes can cause corruption), and recommend >10GB size if possible (it will fill fast)</li>
            <li>I will not store files larger than 4GB on the volume. (Only on Ubuntu as this enables selection of FAT in the next step).</li>
            <li>FAT file system</li>
            <li>Format</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Ensure the encrypted volume file has appropriate permissions...
      <ul><li>Sink: <em>read-write</em> permissions</li><li>Source: <em>read-only</em> permissions</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>In oOoo* <a href="/gateway/add">add a gateway</a> with these details, choosing the <em>sink mode</em> for a gateway to receive clones or <em>source mode</em> to proffer artifacts for other cultists to clone.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>On nothing in particular</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Cultists using Ubuntu should ensure that when removing unwanted files from a gateway that they permanently remove (e.g. shift-delete) the files, as otherwise the file is just moved to a hidden .Trash directory in the gateway root directory.</li>
    <li>Cultist names are plucked at random from the ether.</li>
  </ol>
